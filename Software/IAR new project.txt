How to make a new project:
1. Start with an example project that you think is similar
2. (in the Peripherals Examples folder?) Make a folder for your new project, like "Blinky"
3. Make a EWARM folder in that folder
4. Open IAR
5. Project > Create New Project ...
6. Make an empty project, like "Blinky"
7. Project > Import File List ...
8. Select the project file of the example project you're starting from; the files list becomes populated with references to files from the example project.
9. In the files list, remove everything from the User group.
10. Copy all the files that were referenced in the example project's User group (maybe main.c, stm32f0xx_it.c, some .h files, iunno) from the example project's directory to the new project's directory.
11. Drag the copies into IAR and drop them onto the User group in the files list to add them to the files list.
12. Right click the new project in the files list > Options... (or Project > Options...)
13. Right click the example project in its files list > Options...
14. Make sure all these options are the same:
	In particular, I noticed I needed to
	a. Copy and paste all the directories and symbols listed in the Preprocessor tab of C/C++ Compiler
	I also make these changes
	b. set the device to be the correct chip (ST STM32F051x8), under General Options
	c. check "C++ inline semantics" under the Language 1 tab of C/C++ Compiler
15. To download the application, check the debugger options--you need to change it to ST-Link instead of Simulator and you need to checkmark that it should use the flash loader or something.
