looks like these LED strips consume about 40W/M

If our LED poi are 1/2 meter long each and are double-sided, then they require 1M of LED each
note: the LEDs claim to have 120 degrees of viewing angle, so maybe we actually want to go triple sided.

that means each poi is 40W of LEDs. At 5V, that's 8 amps; we need a 8A discharge rate from our batteries

that said, I'm assuming this is for full brightness, and assumably we'll get better battery life at dimmer settings. In fact, since we're flashing patterns and stuff, we'll probably be effectively running for only half the time at most, but 8 amps will be our peak draw

similarly, if we run the poi at some current C and have some minimum running life, T, then we need a capacity of at least T*C. Say C is at least 4 amps and T is at least 12 minutes. Then, we need at least 800 mAh. blooo

At a bare minimum, C = 2 amps and T = 3 minutes, so we need at least 100 mAh

if actually C = 8 amps, but we were still aiming small in time, like T = 3, then we need 400 mAh

if C is reasonable, like C = 5 amps, and T is reasonable, like T = 15 minutes, then we need like 1250 mAh

so i'm gonna shoot for something in the 1000ish mAh range

also, it would be nice to have somewhat light batteries. Maybe <300g ish, but the lighter the better. that said, it looks like many many 2s 1000ish mAh lipos are less than 300g.


oh, also, these batteries are 4.2V/cell when fully charged. they should stop being discharged at 3.0V/cell to prevent damage, and many RC vehicles have a 3.3V/cell soft cutoff, which we could implement in software
