on the Red, Grn, wht connector and Red/blk connector from the strip, these are connected electrically
red -- red
grn -- nothing
wht -- blk

from this, i assume the following

red -- red	5V PWR
grn -- nothing	logic
wht -- blk	ground

at full brightness, a quarter of the strip (36 LEDs) drew 1.75 Amps on a 5V power supply

The code I used assumed we're running at 800kHz even though the comments suggest that ws2811 products are usually wired to be 400kHz. That said, the ws2811 datasheet confirms that it can be run in either mode.
