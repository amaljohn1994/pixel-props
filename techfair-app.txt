Brief Project Description *
I want to make Pixel Poi, a pair of tubular LED arrays that the user spins while interesting effects appear on the arrays. The effects could be preprogrammed, synced with music, or rely on live sensors.

Budget *
working on it

The Pitch *
Iâ€™ve been learning to spin poi with the MIT Spinning Arts Club since freshman year. poi are tethered weights that a performer spins to create cool effects and illusions. A variety of props can be used at the ends of poi leashes, but an interesting prop developed recently is an array of LEDs. By alternating which LEDs are active, the performer can create cool patterns or trace out images across space. Here's an example of a set that a company sells for over $800.

However, I plan to make a better product than just LEDs and timing cues. The poi I build will detect their motion with sensors and play patterns based on this input. As a performer adjusts his tempo or style, the poi will respond with different patterns. This project will be way cool to see or to play with!

The Deets *
The poi will be constructed with a strip of LEDs in a tube with controller circuitry. Each poi will have an accelerometer and gyroscope, the minimal set of sensors to instantaneously determine the angular velocity, acceleration, and radius of the poi orbit. Painting images looks cool in long exposure shots, so I will implement this capability. I will also implement LED patterns more like those used on a LED feature for a dance party--strobes, pulses, knight rider patterns, etc. To this end, I plan to use the library cursedlite, which was written by my friends for the LEDs on the East Campus Rush fort for the dancy party. For all these patterns, timing will be based on the intertial information from the sensors. Also, the board I produce to drive the LEDs could be used on other props--for example, a pixel staff, and one of my friends plans to build one of these. Finally, if I have time, I would like to implement wireless communication between the poi and from the poi to an external computer, so a light DJ could remotely run the effects.


Timeline *
November
-finish specing out parts
-order parts for prototype

December
-build breadboard circuitry and write code that implements
 -micro communicating with the gyro, the accelerometer, and the LEDs
 -micro doing basic dynamics calculations with gyro and accelerometer data
 -cursedlight library running on micro running LEDs
-lay out and order board for final product
-order case / hardware for final product
 
January
-manufacture case for final product
-assemble circuitry for final product
-write code that uses sensor input to drive LEDs in certain patterns

with any time left, I'd also like to implement wireless communication between the two poi or between them and an external computer.
